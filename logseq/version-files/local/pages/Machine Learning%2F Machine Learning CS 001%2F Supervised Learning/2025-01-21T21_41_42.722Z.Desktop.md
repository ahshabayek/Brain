- Output required dictates the type of task it is classification or regression.
- Classification:
	- Instances: vectors of attributes of the input space.
	- Concept: function that maps inputs to outputs
	- Target concept: The actual answer or truth. The actual function we try to have/imitate.
	- Hypothesis class: An idea out of what? all functions that we re willing to try. a subset of all existing functions, classification in this case.
	- Sample (training set): set of all the inputs and a label of the correct about. Inductive learning.
	- Candidate: the concept that you think might be the target concept. our own assertion.
	- Testing set: similar to a training set. but should be different and not used for learning.
- Regression:
	- Mapping continuous inputs to continuous outputs.
	- Regressing to mean.
		- regression and function approximation:
		- not falling back to mean now, but to approximate values, so no regressing.

- usually we cant use an order higher than the number of the data points we have..

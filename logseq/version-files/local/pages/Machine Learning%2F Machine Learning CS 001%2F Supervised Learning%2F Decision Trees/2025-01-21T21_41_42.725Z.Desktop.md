- Steps:
	- Pick best attribute, best data splits.
	- Asked question about the split
	- follow path of answer
	- repeat till answer

- we look more for any representations than the parity representation above to reduce "questions"
- hardest part is coming up with the best representation. here like using the sum.

- the hypothesis space is very expressive, therefore a need for a smart algorithm

- Entropy is a measure of randomness. A measure of information or likelihood of what we know we will get.

- restriction bias:
	- hypothesis set that we care about. example : set that we can use in a decision tree.
- preference bias:
	- what subsets of the hypothesizes we prefer
	- example: prefer trees with better splits at the top, or correct ones over incorrect ones. also shorter trees than longer ones.
- other constraints:
	- Continous attributes:
		- use ranges.
		- decide range based on media or mean etc.
	- repeating an attribute:
		- for continuous attributes you can repeat for different ranges.
		- for discrete repetition doesnt make sense
	- when to stop?
		- all classified correctly?
		- No Overfitting: happens in DT when tree grows too big
		- breadth first expansion or pruning

- measure error / information gain with variance?
- linear fit or variance/ voting.

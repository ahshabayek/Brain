- using a sequence of noisy observations from one or more sensors to better estimate unknown quantity(state) and associated  uncertainty measures at the time.
- prediction (predicted position)and motion model. old information shows what we knew. update with current information and update prediction adding uncertainty measures.
- repeat and keep updating information.
- Tracking vehicles:
	-
- Pr is a Random variable z is a discrete valued random variable

	- PMF is the integral of the PDF
- COnditional and marginal distributions
	- Conditional rule: P(x,z) =  P(z|x)P(x) or P(z|x) =  P(x,z)/P(x)
	-
- Law of total probability

	- joint probability using the product rule. multiply probability of events happening jointly.
		- sum of joint probabilities should also be 1
		-
- Expectation, covariance and Gaussian distribution
	- expected value or mean is integral is value of x weighted by probability of x
	- E{x} = integral x *p(x) which is also the first moment
	- cov{x} is a column vector rrepresenting the spread of x around its mean value.

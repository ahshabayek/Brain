- Architecture represents the significant design design decisions that shape a system,  where significant is measured by cost" Grady Booch
  
  Design and Architecture are 2 faces of the same coin. Basically the same.
  
  The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.
  The measure of design quality is the effort required to meet the needs. When its low and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system, design is good. If it grows then design is bad.

  # Decision Trees Study Guide
  
  ## ID3 Algorithm
  - **Description**: Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) is a top-down, greedy algorithm for creating decision trees primarily used in classification.
  - **Process**:
    1. Begin with all training examples at the root.
    2. Select the attribute that maximizes information gain as the decision node.
    3. Create branches for each possible attribute value.
    4. Repeat recursively until:
       - All examples are classified correctly, or
       - No remaining attributes exist.
  
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Uses categorical attributes.
    - Results in small, easy-to-interpret trees.
    - Does not naturally handle continuous attributes or missing values.
  
  ---
  
  ## Attribute Selection, Entropy, and Information Gain
  - **Entropy**:
    - Measures impurity or uncertainty in a set of examples.
    - Formula:
      \[
      \text{Entropy}(S) = -\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \log_2(p_i)
      \]
    - \( p_i \) = proportion of examples belonging to class \( i \).
  
  - **Information Gain**:
    - Measures how much an attribute decreases entropy after splitting.
    - Formula:
      \[
      \text{Gain}(S, A) = \text{Entropy}(S) - \sum_{v \in \text{Values}(A)} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|}\text{Entropy}(S_v)
      \]
    - Attribute with the highest gain is selected for splitting.
  
  ---
  
  ## Expressiveness (AND, OR, XOR)
  - **Decision trees can represent**:
    - **AND, OR**: Easily represented by decision trees with simple splits.
    - **XOR**: Decision trees can represent XOR, but require multiple splits (unlike a single perceptron which cannot model XOR).
  
  - **Example**:
    - **AND**: Simple tree with depth 2.
    - **OR**: Simple tree with depth 2.
    - **XOR**: Requires deeper/more branches to separate non-linear decision boundaries clearly.
  
  ---
  
  ## Overfitting, Pruning, and Continuous Features
  - **Overfitting**:
    - Occurs when a tree is overly complex and fits training data noise rather than general patterns.
    - Leads to poor performance on unseen data.
  
  - **Pruning**:
    - Technique to reduce overfitting by removing branches that have little to no predictive power.
    - Types of pruning:
      - **Pre-pruning**: Stop tree growth early (e.g., depth limit, minimum samples per split).
      - **Post-pruning**: Build a full tree and then simplify by removing subtrees or branches based on validation performance.
  
  - **Continuous Features**:
    - Decision trees handle continuous attributes by choosing optimal thresholds (splits).
    - Steps for continuous features:
      1. Sort the continuous feature values.
      2. Evaluate potential thresholds between data points.
      3. Choose the threshold with the highest information gain.

  - Optimizes a cost function (sum of squared distances to cluster centers).
  - No global view: greedy updates, similar to hill climbing.
  
  ### Convergence and Error Minimization
  - Converges to a local minimum of the distortion/error function.
  - Objective:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2
    \]
  
  ### Limitations with Local Optima
  - Can converge to suboptimal solutions depending on initialization.
  - Sensitive to outliers and non-globular clusters.
  - Often mitigated by multiple restarts or using K-Means++ for initialization.
  
  ---
  
  ## Soft Clustering
  - **Description**: Allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with certain probabilities, rather than hard assignments.
  
  ### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
  - Assume data is generated from a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions.
  - Each component represents a soft cluster.
  
  ### Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm
  - Iterative algorithm used to estimate parameters of GMMs.
  
  #### E-step (Expectation):
  - Compute the probability (responsibility) that each point belongs to each cluster using Bayes’ rule.
  
  #### M-step (Maximization):
  - Update the parameters (means, covariances, and mixing weights) to maximize the expected log-likelihood given the current assignments.
  
  - **Advantages**:
    - Captures overlapping clusters.
    - Handles elliptical and skewed distributions better than K-Means.
  
  ---
  
  ## Clustering Properties
  
  ### Richness
  - Any possible clustering of the data can be achieved by some input metric.
  
  ### Scale Invariance
  - Clustering should not change if all distances are multiplied by a constant.
  
  ### Consistency
  - If distances within clusters shrink and between clusters grow, the clustering should not change.
  
  ### Kleinberg’s Impossibility Theorem
  - **Statement**: No clustering function can satisfy all three desirable properties (richness, scale invariance, and consistency) simultaneously.
  - **Implication**: There's no perfect clustering algorithm; trade-offs must be made depending on the application.

  # Feature Transformation Study Guide
  
  ## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - **Purpose**: Unsupervised method for dimensionality reduction by finding new axes (principal components) that maximize variance in the data.
  - **Key Concepts**:
    - Transforms correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated components.
    - Projects data onto the directions (eigenvectors) of maximum variance.
  
  ### Maximize Variance, Reduce Dimensionality
  - Captures the most significant structure in the data using fewer features.
  - Often used for data visualization and noise reduction.
  
  ### Eigenvectors/Eigenvalues
  - **Eigenvectors**: Directions of the new axes (principal components).
  - **Eigenvalues**: Correspond to the amount of variance captured by each principal component.
  - Retain top \(k\) components with the highest eigenvalues.
  
  ### Orthogonal Projections
  - Project data onto orthogonal (uncorrelated) axes.
  - Ensures no redundancy among principal components.
  
  ---
  
  ## Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
  - **Purpose**: Unsupervised method to transform data into statistically independent components.
  - **Key Idea**: Unlike PCA (which uses uncorrelatedness), ICA maximizes independence between components.
  
  ### Maximize Statistical Independence
  - Finds components that are not only uncorrelated but also independent in distribution.
  - Useful for discovering latent (hidden) variables.
  
  ### Cocktail Party Problem
  - Canonical example for ICA.
  - Objective: Separate mixed signals (e.g., individual voices recorded from multiple microphones).
  
  ### Useful for Source Separation
  - Applications in audio processing, biomedical signals (EEG), image processing.
  
  ---
  
  ## Random Component Analysis (RCA)
  - **Description**: Projects data into a lower-dimensional space using random projection matrices.
  - **Key Advantages**:
    - Extremely fast and computationally cheap.
    - Preserves pairwise distances with high probability (Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma).
    - Suitable for large-scale or streaming data.
  
  - **Trade-offs**:
    - No guarantee of preserving interpretability or structure like PCA or ICA.
    - Less precise but highly efficient.
  
  ---
  
  ## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  - **Description**: A supervised dimensionality reduction technique that finds the linear combinations of features that best separate two or more classes.
  
  ### Supervised Transformation
  - Unlike PCA/ICA, LDA uses class labels during transformation.
  - Maximizes the **between-class variance** and minimizes the **within-class variance**.
  
  ### Emphasizes Label-Based Separation
  - Projects data onto a space where classes are most distinguishable.
  - Often used as a preprocessing step for classification tasks.
  
  - **Limitations**:
    - Assumes normally distributed classes with equal covariance matrices.
    - Less effective when class distributions violate these assumptions.
  
  ---
  
  # Information Theory Study Guide
  
  ## Entropy
  - **Definition**: A measure of uncertainty or unpredictability in a random variable.
  - **Formula**:
    \[
    H(X) = -\sum_{x \in X} P(x) \log_2 P(x)
    \]
  - **Interpretation**: Higher entropy means more unpredictability. If outcomes are equally likely, entropy is maximized.
  - **Use Case**: Foundational to measuring information content, compression, and decision-making.
  
  ---
  
  ## Joint and Conditional Entropy
  
  ### Joint Entropy
  - **Definition**: Entropy of two variables taken together.
  - **Formula**:
    \[
    H(X, Y) = -\sum_{x, y} P(x, y) \log_2 P(x, y)
    \]
  - **Interpretation**: Measures uncertainty of the pair \((X, Y)\).
  
  ### Conditional Entropy
  - **Definition**: Entropy of a variable \( Y \) given another variable \( X \).
  - **Formula**:
    \[
    H(Y|X) = -\sum_{x, y} P(x, y) \log_2 P(y|x)
    \]
  - **Interpretation**: Average uncertainty remaining about \( Y \) when \( X \) is known.
  
  ---
  
  ## Mutual Information
  - **Definition**: Measures the amount of information one variable contains about another.
  - **Formula**:
    \[
    I(X; Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)
    \]
  - **Interpretation**: 
    - 0 if variables are independent.
    - Higher values indicate stronger dependence.
  - **Applications**: Feature selection, clustering, evaluating learned representations.
  
  ---
  
  ## Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence
  - **Definition**: A measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected distribution.
  - **Formula**:
    \[
    D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log_2 \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
    \]
  - **Properties**:
    - Not symmetric: \( D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) \neq D_{KL}(Q \parallel P) \)
    - \( D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) \geq 0 \), equality only when \( P = Q \)
  
  - **Interpretation**: Measures inefficiency of assuming \( Q \) when the true distribution is \( P \).
  
  ---
  
  ## Message Encoding Efficiency
  
  ### Variable-Length Codes
  - Assign shorter codes to more probable messages.
  - **Examples**: Huffman coding, Morse code.
  - Improve compression by reducing average code length.
  
  ### Entropy as Bit Cost Lower Bound
  - **Shannon’s Source Coding Theorem**:
    - The average number of bits required to encode symbols from a source cannot be less than the entropy:
      \[
      \text{Average bits} \geq H(X)
      \]
  - **Implication**: Entropy defines the theoretical limit of lossless compression.
  
  ---
  
  # Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) Study Guide
  
  ## Grid World Examples, Multiple Solutions
  - **Grid World**: A common toy example to visualize MDPs with discrete states and actions (e.g., move up/down/left/right).
  - **Multiple Solutions**: Different policies may yield similar returns, especially in symmetric or deterministic environments.
  
  ---
  
  ## Stochastic Transitions and Uncertainty
  - **Stochastic Transitions**: Taking an action may result in different outcomes with certain probabilities.
  - **Uncertainty**: Reflects the non-deterministic nature of real environments; requires models that can handle probabilistic outcomes.
  
  ---
  
  ## States, Actions, Transitions
  - **State (\(S\))**: Describes the current situation of the agent.
  - **Action (\(A\))**: Choices available to the agent in each state.
  - **Transition Function (\(T(s, a, s')\))**: Probability of moving to state \(s'\) when taking action \(a\) in state \(s\).
  
  ---
  
  ## Markov Property (Memoryless Transitions)
  - **Definition**: The outcome of an action depends only on the current state and action—not on the past history.
  - **Formally**:
    \[
    P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) = P(s_{t+1} | s_1, a_1, ..., s_t, a_t)
    \]
  
  ---
  
  ## Stationarity and Time Horizons
  - **Stationarity**: Transition and reward functions do not change over time.
  - **Time Horizons**:
    - **Finite Horizon**: Limited number of time steps.
    - **Infinite Horizon**: Continues indefinitely, usually with discounting to ensure convergence.
  
  ---
  
  ## Reward Structures: Per State, Per Transition
  - **Per State Reward**: Reward depends only on the state the agent is in.
  - **Per Transition Reward**: Reward depends on the current state, action, and resulting next state.
  
  ---
  
  ## Policies: Mapping States to Actions
  - **Policy (\( \pi \))**: A function that maps states to actions.
    - **Deterministic Policy**: Always selects the same action for a given state.
    - **Stochastic Policy**: Specifies probabilities for taking each action in a state.
  
  ---
  
  ## Optimal Policy (\( \pi^* \)) and Expected Return
  - **Optimal Policy (\( \pi^* \))**: Yields the highest expected cumulative reward from any starting state.
  - **Expected Return**: Sum of rewards the agent expects to accumulate over time when following a policy.
  
  ---
  
  ## Value Functions and Utility Over Sequences
  - **State Value Function \( V^\pi(s) \)**:
    \[
    V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t) \mid s_0 = s, \pi \right]
    \]
  - **Action Value Function \( Q^\pi(s, a) \)**:
    \[
    Q^\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t) \mid s_0 = s, a_0 = a, \pi \right]
    \]
  - Represent utility of states or state-action pairs under a given policy.
  
  ---
  
  ## Discounted Rewards (\( \gamma \)) for Infinite Horizon
  - **Discount Factor (\( \gamma \))**:
    - \( 0 \leq \gamma < 1 \): Future rewards are worth less than immediate rewards.
    - Ensures the sum of infinite rewards converges.
  - **Effect**: Balances short-term vs. long-term rewards.
  
  ---
  
  ## Bellman Equation
  - **Recursive Definition** of the value of a state under an optimal policy:
    \[
    V^*(s) = \max_{a} \sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^*(s') \right]
    \]
  - **Interpretation**: The value of a state equals the best expected return achievable by taking an optimal action.
  
  ---
  
  ## Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
  
  ### Value Iteration
  - Iteratively update value estimates using the Bellman optimality equation.
  - Pseudocode:
    1. Initialize \( V(s) = 0 \) for all \( s \).
    2. Repeat until convergence:
       \[
       V(s) \leftarrow \max_a \sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V(s') \right]
       \]
    3. Extract the policy:  
       \[
       \pi(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V(s') \right]
       \]
  
  ### Policy Iteration
  - Alternates between evaluating a policy and improving it:
    1. **Policy Evaluation**: Compute \( V^\pi \) for the current policy.
    2. **Policy Improvement**: Update the policy by choosing better actions:
       \[
       \pi(s) \leftarrow \arg\max_a \sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') \left[ R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^\pi(s') \right]
       \]
  
  - Typically converges faster than value iteration.
  
  ---
  
  # Reinforcement Learning Overview
  
  ## Difference Between Planning and Learning
  - **Planning**:
    - Assumes a known model of the environment (transition and reward functions).
    - Uses algorithms like **Value Iteration** or **Policy Iteration** to compute optimal policies.
    - No actual interaction with the environment needed.
  
  - **Learning**:
    - Environment model is **unknown**; agent must learn optimal behavior through experience.
    - Learns value functions or policies by sampling transitions during interaction.
  
  ---
  
  ## Model-Based vs Model-Free RL
  
  ### Model-Based RL
  - **Learns or uses a model** of the environment (i.e., transition probabilities and reward function).
  - Can use the learned model to plan or simulate outcomes (e.g., via Dynamic Programming or Dyna-Q).
  - **Pros**: Enables simulation and foresight.
  - **Cons**: Requires accurate model learning, which can be hard.
  
  ### Model-Free RL
  - **Does not assume access to a model** of the environment.
  - Learns optimal policies or value functions directly from experience.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Q-Learning** (off-policy)
    - **SARSA** (on-policy)
  
  - **Pros**: Simpler, works well in unknown or complex environments.
  - **Cons**: Slower learning, needs more exploration.
  
  ---
  
  ## Exploration vs Exploitation
  - **Exploration**:
    - Trying new actions to discover their effects and improve the policy.
    - Important to avoid suboptimal behavior due to incomplete knowledge.
  
  - **Exploitation**:
    - Choosing the best-known action to maximize immediate reward.
  
  - **Balancing Strategies**:
    - **ε-Greedy**: Choose random action with probability ε, otherwise choose best-known action.
    - **Decaying ε**: Decrease ε over time to shift from exploration to exploitation.
    - **Softmax/Boltzmann Exploration**: Select actions probabilistically based on their estimated value.
  
  ---
  
  ## Learning from Transitions (State, Action, Reward, Next State)
  - **Transition Tuple**: \( (s, a, r, s') \)
    - \( s \): Current state
    - \( a \): Action taken
    - \( r \): Reward received
    - \( s' \): Next state reached
  
  - **Purpose**: Use these experiences to update value functions or policies.
  
  - **Q-Learning Update Rule**:
    \[
    Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
    \]
  
  - **SARSA Update Rule** (on-policy):
    \[
    Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
    \]
  
  - These updates allow the agent to learn optimal actions over time through interaction.
  
  ---
  
  # Q-Learning Study Guide
  
  ## Q-Values (State-Action Utilities)
  - **Definition**: Q-values, \( Q(s, a) \), represent the expected cumulative reward of taking action \( a \) in state \( s \), and then following the optimal policy thereafter.
  - **Purpose**: Guides agents in choosing actions to maximize long-term rewards.
  
  ---
  
  ## Estimating Q from Data
  - Q-values are learned incrementally from experience using transition samples:
    \[
    (s, a, r, s')
    \]
  - No model of the environment is required.
  - Uses observed rewards and estimated future returns to refine Q-value estimates.
  
  ---
  
  ## Q-Learning Update Rule
  - **Core Equation**:
    \[
    Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
    \]
  - **Terms**:
    - \( \alpha \): Learning rate
    - \( \gamma \): Discount factor
    - \( r \): Reward observed after action \( a \) in state \( s \)
    - \( s' \): Resulting state
  - **Off-policy**: Learns the optimal policy regardless of the agent’s behavior.
  
  ---
  
  ## Convergence Guarantees
  - **Q-learning converges** to the optimal Q-values under the following conditions:
    - All state-action pairs are visited infinitely often.
    - Learning rate \( \alpha_t \) decays appropriately:
      - \( \sum \alpha_t = \infty \), but \( \sum \alpha_t^2 < \infty \)
    - The environment is a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with finite states and actions.
  
  ---
  
  ## Learning Rate \( \alpha \) and Decay Conditions
  - \( \alpha \): Controls how much new information overrides old knowledge.
    - High \( \alpha \): Fast learning but unstable.
    - Low \( \alpha \): Slow but stable learning.
  
  - **Decay Strategy**:
    - Gradually decrease \( \alpha \) over time (e.g., \( \alpha_t = \frac{1}{1+t} \)) to ensure convergence.
    - Prevents overreacting to noisy updates later in learning.
  
  ---
  
  ## Action Selection Strategies
  
  ### Epsilon-Greedy
  - **Approach**:
    - With probability \( \varepsilon \): choose a random action (explore).
    - With probability \( 1 - \varepsilon \): choose the action with the highest Q-value (exploit).
  - **Common Practice**: Use a decaying \( \varepsilon \) to shift from exploration to exploitation over time.
  
  ### Random Restarts
  - Restart the agent in random states or episodes periodically.
  - Encourages broader exploration and avoids local optima.
  
  ### Simulated Annealing
  - **Idea**: Start with high exploration that decreases over time.
  - Gradually reduce the probability of taking suboptimal actions (temperature-like parameter).
  - Inspired by Simulated Annealing in optimization:
    \[
    P(\text{accept suboptimal}) = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta Q}{T}\right)
    \]
  
  ---
  
  # Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff Study Guide
  
  ## Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty
  - **Principle**: Assume unknown actions or states have high potential reward until proven otherwise.
  - **Motivation**: Encourages the agent to try unvisited actions to gather information.
  - **Example**: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms add an exploration bonus to less-visited actions:
    \[
    Q(s, a) + c \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\log t}{N(s, a)}}
    \]
    - \( N(s, a) \): Number of times action \( a \) has been taken in state \( s \)
    - \( c \): Controls the level of optimism
  - Helps reduce regret over time by exploring actions that could be better than current estimates.
  
  ---
  
  ## Importance of Choosing Good Exploratory Strategies
  - **Random exploration** (e.g., ε-greedy) is simple but may be inefficient.
  - **Informed strategies** (e.g., Boltzmann/softmax, UCB) consider action quality and uncertainty.
  - Poor exploration can lead to:
    - Premature convergence to suboptimal policies.
    - Incomplete knowledge of the environment.
  - Good strategies trade short-term loss for long-term gain by improving model accuracy.
  
  ---
  
  ## Balancing Learning and Usage
  - **Exploration**: Learning new information about the environment.
  - **Exploitation**: Using current knowledge to maximize reward.
  - **Challenge**: Too much exploration wastes time; too much exploitation can miss better options.
  
  ### Strategies to Balance:
  - **ε-Greedy with Decay**: Reduce exploration as learning progresses.
  - **Simulated Annealing**: Gradually decrease randomness based on "temperature."
  - **Bayesian Methods**: Use probabilistic reasoning to explore actions with high uncertainty.
  
  - **Goal**: Ensure sufficient exploration early on, then favor exploitation as confidence increases.
  
  ---

  - **Deterministic**: No randomness in transitions or payoffs.
  - **Goal**: Find optimal strategies where one player maximizes their payoff while minimizing the opponent’s.
  
  ---
  
  ## Game Matrices and Pure/Mixed Strategies

  - **Mixed Strategy**: Player chooses actions probabilistically.
  
  ---
  
  ## Minimax and Maximin Strategies
  - **Minimax**: Choose a strategy that minimizes the maximum possible loss (pessimistic but safe).
    \[
    \min_{\pi_1} \max_{\pi_2} L(\pi_1, \pi_2)
    \]
  - **Maximin**: Maximize the minimum gain you can ensure regardless of the opponent's move.
  - **Equivalence**: In zero-sum games, minimax = maximin = game value.
  
  ---
  
  ## Nash Equilibrium
  - **Definition**: A set of strategies where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy.
  - Can involve **mixed strategies**.
  - Every finite game has at least one Nash equilibrium (may be in mixed strategies).
  
  ---
  
  ## Dominant Strategies and Strict Dominance
  - **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy that yields the best payoff regardless of what others do.
  - **Strict Dominance**: A strategy that is strictly better than another strategy in all scenarios.
  - Dominated strategies can be eliminated to simplify analysis.
  
  ---
  
  ## Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma
  - A repeated version of the classic game where players can learn and adapt over time.
  - Payoff structure favors defection in one-shot games but cooperation can emerge over repeated interactions.
  
  ---
  
  ## Tit-for-Tat Strategy (Finite-State Representation)
  - **Definition**: Start by cooperating, then mimic the opponent’s previous move.
  - **Properties**:
    - Simple, forgiving, retaliatory.
    - Often performs well in repeated settings.
  
  ---
  
  ## Best Responses in Repeated Games
  - A **best response** is the strategy that yields the highest payoff given the opponent’s strategy.
  - Players can learn to converge toward equilibria over time.
  
  ---
  
  ## Folk Theorem (in Repeated Games)
  - **Statement**: In infinitely repeated games, a wide range of outcomes (including cooperation) can be sustained as equilibrium, even if the stage game has a non-cooperative equilibrium.
  - **Requirements**:
    - Sufficiently high discount factor (value on future payoffs).
    - Credible punishment for deviation.
  
  ---
  
  ## Minimax Profiles, Security Levels
  - **Minimax Profile**: Strategy that secures the minimum possible loss regardless of the opponent.
  - **Security Level**: Worst-case payoff that a player can guarantee by playing a minimax strategy.
  
  ---
  
  ## Grim Trigger Strategies
  - **Strategy**: Cooperate until the opponent defects once—then defect forever.
  - **Use**: Enforces cooperation through the threat of permanent punishment.
  
  ---
  
  ## Implausible Threats and Subgame Perfection
  - **Implausible Threat**: A threat that a rational player would not actually carry out.
  - **Subgame Perfect Equilibrium**:
    - Strengthens Nash equilibrium by requiring rational play in every subgame.
    - Eliminates non-credible threats.

	- knowledge base and rules of inference

- so far only propositional logic used, zero order logic
- predicate calculus: first order logic

- resolution theorm proofing

	- convert every sentence into conjuctive normal form
		- literal positive or negative
		- disjuctional literal
		- conjunction disjuctional literal
	- proof by refutation
- resolution theorm proofing
	- first every sentence into a conjunctive normal form.

	- elimination of the thing and its not is resolution

- conjunction is an and. disjunction is an or
- more complex
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1718368972227_0.png)
	- we convert to conjunctive normal form. so contain literals or disjinction of literals or conjunction of disjunction of literals.
	- we then reach a null or a contradiction:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1718369030224_0.png)
	- the rise of this approach is due to horn clauses:
		- it is a disjunction that contains at most one positive literal
	-
- if you dont find null condition then the sentence cant be proved

- deduvtive logic: reasoning from causes to effects
- inductive logic: reasoning from relationship of cause an effect for a sample to population.
- abduction logic: reasoning from effects to causes data to explanation to a category for the data

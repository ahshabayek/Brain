- a problem solving method
- solutions to a problem then test
- no infinite computational resources, no complete knowledge of the world to check best optimality
- protentional  or plausible solutions then.
- generator and tester
	- generator produces all states
	- tester remove states that re nt possible
- combinatorial explosion happens
- dum generator and tester is very inefficient
- a coupling between a knowledge representation and problem solving> semantic networks and generate and test
- genetic algorithms are a smart test problem approach
- knowledge representation defines/provides the level of abstraction for the generator and tester to stick to

- weak methods, as coupling is limited.

- combination of methods can often be used.

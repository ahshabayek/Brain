	- Big picture Rules:
		- Pick your reading goal:
			- Intention behind read and extraction goal. read based on that.
		- Understand author's goal:
			- who is the author, interests and field of expertise and how the writing fits in.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1736182709358_0.png)
		- Ask six questions:
			- What the author wants to know/ motivation?
			- What did they do/ approach?
			- Why was it done that way?
			- What does the results show?
			- How did the author interpret the results?
			- What should be done next?(also ask yourself)
		- Unpack figures and Tables:
			- Either asses data first or main text both are valid. The key is to understand data and how it is obtained.
			- Identify experimental groups and variables. Refer back to appropriate sections when further details are needed answering the six Qs.
		- Understand the formatting intentions:
			- Each section format should guide interpertation.
			- All influenced by author's interpretation.
			- check relevant website for further formatting intentions. For also goal of each section.
		-
	- Philosophy of reading Rules:
		- Be critical:
			- Reader must be able to or attempt to pushback author's ideas even if they align with your own hypothesis.
			- Find mistakes or limitations in methodology and limits to generalizability(selection bias, unaddressed or unappreciated confounders.
		- Be Kind:
			- Give benefit of the doubt.
			- Consider reference count limit.
			- Avoid evaluations based on minor errors.
			- Be kind in sharing critiques of the work.
		- Be ready  to go the extra mile:
			- Dig up terms you don't understand.
			- Read three times to digest
				- read without pressure of understanding, second aim to understand and third take notes.
	- Now what? Whats next Rules:
		- Talk about it:
			- Force active reading and participation.
			- Teach it.
		- Build on it:
			- Present it, make each into small bricks/lego that fit into a larger wall.
			- integrate knowledge from different research papers.
			- Connect it with your own work and ideas.
			- challenge and/or support the hypothesis with a more extensive review.
- Rules for structuring papers:
	- ![ten_simple_rules_structuring_papers_kording_mensh.pdf](../assets/ten_simple_rules_structuring_papers_kording_mensh_1736607044887_0.pdf)
	- A successful paper communicates the connections between data, methods, and
	  interpretations.
	- Principles:
		- Present only one central contribution per paper, which you communicate in the title.
			- Science is, after all, the
			  abstraction of simple principles from complex data.
		- Write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know your work:
			- Consider the perspective of a less qualified person than you in the topic.
			- Consider human psychology and mind limitations in writing, working memory capacity and other simliar constraints/behaviors.
		- Stick to the context-content-conclusion (CCC) scheme:
			- The beginning sets up the context for the story,
			  while the body (content) advances the story towards an ending where the problems
			  find their conclusion.
		- Optimize your logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism:
			- Or related ideas should be strung together.
			- one word for every concept for easier reference.
	- The components of a paper:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1736458836293_0.png)
		- Tell a complete story in the abstract:
			- entire message of paper present.
			- Each of the C-C-C has 2 pieces:
				- Context:
					- first broader field for the research.
					- then narrowed to the question paper answers.
					- what is missing in the literature and why matters.
				- Content:
					- approach chosen to answer question.
					- avoid highly technical words.
				- Conclusion:
				- Results should fill in the gap.
				- Dont mention results before reader understands the idea.
			-
			- Get across why the paper matters in the introduction.
				- First paragraph may explain why
				  understanding cell differentiation is an important topic and that the field has not yet
				  solved what triggers it (a field gap)
				- second paragraph may explain what is
				  unknown about the differentiation of a specific cell type such as astrocytes (a
				  subfield gap).
				- A third may provide clues that a particular gene might drive
				  astrocytic differentiation, then state that this hypothesis is untested (the gap within
				  the subfield that you will fill).
				- all paragraphs except last sub serves developing the gap.
				- Introduction should not contain a
				  literature review beyond the motivation of the paper.
				- Last paragraph compactly summarizes the
				  results, which fill the gap you just established. No need for context, more specificity about results.
			- Communicate the results as a sequence of statements that build on one
			  another to support the central contribution:
				- Support claim with data and logic.
				- can have multiple hypothesis and disprove them and focus on one.
				- Sketch a logical structure.
				- First paragraph should summarize overall approach outlined in intro.
				- Each subsequent paragraph in the results section starts with a sentence or two
				  setting up the question that the paragraph answer.
				- The middle of the paragraph presents data and logic that pertain to the question, and
				  the paragraph ends with a sentence that answers the question.
				- Each paragraph convinces the reader of the answer given in its last sentence
			- Discuss how the gap was filled, the limitations of the interpretation, and
			  the relevance to the field:
				- first discussion paragraph is special in that it generally summarizes the important findings from the results section.
				- Each following paragraph in the discussion section starts by describing an area of
				  weakness or strength of the paper.
				- It then evaluates the strength or weakness by extensively linking into the relevant literature
				- Lastly, it concludes about the authorsâ€™ way of perceiving the contribution, discussing potential ways for going forward
		- Process:
			- Allocate time where it matters: Title, abstract, figures, and outlining:
				- logical structure of the paper is planned in concert with experiments being performed
				- Communicate with reader.
			- Get feedback to reduce, reuse, and recycle the story:
				- Writing is an optimization of the problem in which you improve the story.
				- Multiple reviews.

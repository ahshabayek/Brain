- one weakness distinguish between probable and improbable solutions.
- Propositional Logic:
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1731883687906_0.png)
	- Terminology :
		- valid is always true in all models
		- satisfiable is valid in some models
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1732140446860_0.png)
	- limitations:
		- no uncertainty representations
		- only events no objects
		- no shortcuts
- First order logic:
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1732142055110_0.png)
	- has structured representations e.g: relationships  etc.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1732142645409_0.png){:height 276, :width 508}
	- relations are on objects but not on relations(higher order logic)

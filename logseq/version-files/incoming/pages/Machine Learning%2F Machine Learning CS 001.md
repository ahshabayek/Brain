- Philosophy:
	- Computational statistics/ applied statistics?
	- broader notion of building artifacts that matter, intelligent that learn over time.
	- 3 parts:
		- Supervised
		- Unspervised
		- Reinforcement Learning
	- Leap of faith in prediction
	- Induction, from examples to a general rule
	- Deduction from rules to example: classical AI
	- Supervised is function approximation.
	- Unsupervised learning is about description/ summarization.
		- density estimation.
	- Reinforcement Learning:
		- Learning from delayed reward.
		- no correct label of correctness, just the outcome whether good bad , correct or incorrect.
	- Supervised and unsupervised can be turned into each other.

	- Data data data
	- Algorithm stops being central the algorithm start being central or coequal.
- Machine Learning - Murphy (way too many proofs for this course, better for a Theoretical Machine Learning class, or even follow up to this course)
  Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning - Bishop (slightly outside the scope of the course)
  Probabilistic Graphical Models - Koller and Friedman (great follow up book after this class)
  Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms - McKay (breaks down a lot of the signal process theory)
  Reinforcement Learning - Sutton and Barto (be-all end-all book for RL at the moment. Think Rudin for Proofs).
  Deep Learning - Goodfellow (godfather of GANs and second generation after LeCun. This is also the standard for DL teachings)
  Data Science for Business - Provost and Fawcett (outstanding visualizations and practicum)

- different from learning by recorded case as new cases might not fit any visited before, but an entirely new one.

	- retrieval is like learning by recorded and k neighbours
	- patterns are existing in the physical world and must be accounted by intelligence as possibility.

	- Adaptation:
		- mostly tweaking if we have good retrieval
		- model based method:
			- find an approximately close or similar case then adapt with adding a small solution.
		- case based reasoning recursively:
			- partial solutions from different problems. composite solution made of 2 or more seperate ones
			- compound analogy
		- case adaption by rules:
			- define a heuristic, rule of thumb that works often not always.
	- case storage:
		- indexing:

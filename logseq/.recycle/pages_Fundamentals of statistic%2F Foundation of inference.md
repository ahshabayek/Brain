- Parameteric statistical models
	- Estimation
	- confidence intervals
	- Hypothesis testing
- Trinity of statistical inference
	- Estimation:
		- parameters of distribution
		- random variable is the the estimator itself.
	- Confidence interval
		- error interval
	- Hypothesis testing
		- yes no answer
- why do statistical model:
	- learn distribution of  X and its parameters.
	- Poisson distribution to model number of anything.
- what is a statistical model:
	- outcome of observed  statistical experiment be a sample of random variables in a measurable space
	- always a pair, the space where the random variables live and a family of probability distributions. also the parameter set
- Parametric , non and semi parametric models.
	- well specified probability model
	- parametric is within finite space
	- non parametric within infinite space.
	- probability models are parametric.

- Mixtures of Gaussians:
	- unimodal = one maxima
	- weighted average of 2 random variables
	- latent variable, indicate from which distribution to use. it has to be independent from both RV

- Identifiable models : from a huge set of outputs input can be discerned .

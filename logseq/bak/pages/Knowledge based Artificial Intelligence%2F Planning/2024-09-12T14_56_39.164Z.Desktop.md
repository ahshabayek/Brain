- all operations are positive and remain true after being applied for precondition
- post condition can have negative propositions
- map history into action selection

- heuristic approach : means end analysis would pick the final higher cost transition blind to consequence. creates a condition that obstructs other goals.

- partial order planning:
	- also called non linear planning

	- OPen condition problem:
		- use operator that matches precondition:

- Different agents were required for each operations:
	- Agent for generating plans for each goal
	- another for detecting conflicts
	- another for resolving them
- partial order planning:
	- emerging out of interaction between agents 3

- y_{i\:}\longleftarrow\: y_i+\alpha\left(x_i-y_i\right)+\beta\left(y_{i+1}+y_{i-1}-2y_i\right)
- what if smoothing puts us in a path with  an obstacle?
	- use dynamic programming with stochastic action function to push you away,
	- or include a term to push away from obstacles.
- fix inbound smoothing in cyclic world or else:

- PID control:
	- Problem statment:
		- how would you set steering angle to follow along a line
			- steer according to cross track error
		- P is for proportional
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1709219452726_0.png)
		- correction will always overshoot, and will at best best be marginally stable.:

			- move to front  axle:
				- y_distance_to_front_axle = math.sin(robot.orientation) * robot.length
				  cte = robot.y + y_distance_to_front_axle
			- to remove oscillations:

			- then to deal with bias or systematic error:

- integral windup, to account for system limits that are not apparent. max steer thrust or so that is not acquirable.

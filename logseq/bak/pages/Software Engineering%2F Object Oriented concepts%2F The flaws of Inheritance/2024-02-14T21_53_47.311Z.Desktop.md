- Composition v.s inheritance:
	- Inheritance forces structure of parent even when its not needed.
	- change is the enemy of perfect design.
- What is composition:
	- reusing code without inheritance
	- pass in object ,  create class that does changes instead.
	- extends and reuses but also abstraction.
	- cons:
		- initialize all internal types, code will be repeated
		- alot of wrapper methods when in need to expose info from internal types
	- Pros:
		- reduces coupling to reused code.
		- adaptable as changes come in.
- Interfaces
	- what a class can do:
	- only critical part of the contract and are tact on existing classes.
	- Dependency Injection: passing in interface of what you re going to do.
- Inheritance when to use:
	- Highly repetitive code with few needed changes.
	- tips:
		- avoid  protected member variables with direct access
		- create apis for everything
		- all else private.

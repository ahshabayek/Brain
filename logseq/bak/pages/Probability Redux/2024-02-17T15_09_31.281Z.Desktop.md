- Recall the statements of the **(strong/weak) law of large numbers**  and the **central limit theorem**  and know to apply these for large sample sizes.
- (Optional:) Apply **Hoeffding's inequality**  to the sample means of bounded i.i.d. random variables.
- Recall the probability density function and properties of the **Gaussian distribution** .
- Use **Gaussian probability tables**  to obtain probabilities and **quantiles** .
- Distinguish between **convergence almost surely** , **convergence in probability**  and **convergence in distribution** , understand that these notions are from strongest to weakest.
- Determine convergence of sums and products of sequences that converge almost surely or in probability.
- Apply **Slutsky's theorem**  to the sum and product of a sequence that converges in distribution and another that converges in probability to a constant.
- Use the **continuous mapping theorem**  to determine convergence of sequences of a function of random variables.

- LLn doesnt handle cases as 1/ log log log n
- while central limit theorem approximates to some degree to Gaussian it could also reach the same road block but most likely doesnt as shown by berry essen bounds.
- when is close? rule of thumb n> =30

- Hoeffding's inequality:
	- not as generic as CTL
	- random variables that are surely bounded.
	- rules out Gaussians, exponentials RVs. anything that takes on arbitrary variables. large or small.
	- works with RVs like Bernoulli.
	- provides an exponential decay, n doesnt need to be large.
	- multiply gaussians rule:
		- mean is multiplied by  this number
		- variance it multiplied by the square root of the number.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1684700392553_0.png)
	- more conservative than CTL but less precise .

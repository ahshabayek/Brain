- Computing runtime:
	- asymptotic notation:
		- Ignore constant multiples that dont affect algorithms aka ignore runtime.
		- how does it scale with size.
		- only care about large scale behavior.
	- Big O notation:
		- clarifies growth.
		- Ignores constant multiples and factors differentiating 2 algos.
		- sometimes large data scaling isnt relvant to application therefore Big Os notation is unfair to algos that are better at smaller datasizes.

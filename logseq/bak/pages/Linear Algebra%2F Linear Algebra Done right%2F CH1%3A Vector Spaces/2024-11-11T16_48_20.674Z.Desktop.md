- Rn & Cn
	- real numbers cant be squared to yield a negative number , therefore imaginary numbers exist.
	- Cn = {a + bi : a,b belong to R}
	- Why multiplying Imaginary s yield non imaginary?
	- i == \[\sqrt{ -1}\]
	- i^{2} = -1
	- Properties of complex arithmetic:
		- commutativity: order of elements undergoing the operation doesnt matter
		- associativity:  pairing of elements sharing the same operation between them doesnt matter
		- identities
		- additive inverse: for every value a negating (summing to zero) opposite exists
		- multiplicative inverse : an opposing value normalizing to 1 exists
		- distributive property:
	- R &C are what can be called fields.
	- F can either be an R or a C.
	- list is an ordered collection of n(non negative finite number) elements which can be numbers list or other abstract entities.
	- list vs set:
		- set (3,5)  is  \neq  set (5,3)  while the 2 lists {3,5} \& {5,3} are equal
		- set (4,4)  is  \neq  set (4,4,4)  , not the same length. while lists {4,4} \& {4,4,4} both equal the set {4}.

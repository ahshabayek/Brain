- kalman filter vs monte carlo localization
	- kalman is continuous/uni modal while monte carlo is discrete and multi- modal.
	- usually gaussian is used as the unimodal(single peak distribbbution)

- Multivariant Gaussians for higher dimension Kalman filter
	- mean  is now a vector , one  element for each of the dimensions.
	- variance is now covariance: DxD size.

- Design a Kalman filter:
	- state transition function for state: a matrix
	- measurement function.

	- y is the error
	- error is mapped by variable S, K is Kalman gain.

- Q is model errors. used to account for inaccurate design /model  or F matrix not suitable to problem.(to include errors in the model)
- Uncertainty P model is part of v(motion)
- measurement is also known as observations.
- measurement noise == measurement uncertainty
- ![image.png](../assets/image_1706049248533_0.png)
- gain is weighting term (innovation covariance)/  ratio of uncertainty predicted measurement to total uncertainty in measurement/observation and prediction.
- ![image.png](../assets/image_1706049626042_0.png)
- result covariance will be smaller than both measurement and predicted.

- H indicator matrix.
- 2  covariance matrix, 1 for state  = variance for each.
- P intialization value need to make sense as a value in the state space of each state. not too small not too large. better a larger then smaller value.

- if black dots are mostly not in the red envelop the R might be too small
- Innovation is the measurement -expected measurement
- Kalman filter is a whitening filter

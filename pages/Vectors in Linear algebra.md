- [[Linear Algebra]]
-
- Vector is an ordered array
- each entry is a component.
- Components  are Indexed starting 0
- Belongs to real numbers
- Has direction and length starting from origin point.
- Length is euclidean
- Unit Basis Vectors(Standard basis vectors)
	- of size n of zeros except 1 component which is the indicated index one e.g: e of 3 , third is 1.
	- Generalizes notation to arbitrary length vectors.

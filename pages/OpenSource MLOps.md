- MLOPS Goals
	- Achieve best performance
	- Ensure reproducibility
		- transparency and team collabration
		- audits
	- Minimal setup and dependcy of 3rd party services
		- vendor lock in
		- maintence cost
		- security
- DVC helps ensure versioning of everything dataset models other artifacts
- DVC pipeline
	- data_load
	- featurize
	- data split
		- Evaluate
		- Train
- a sequence of python or Jupyter
- once all pipeline is ready exec like such
	- ``` pipline
	  dvc exp run -S train.params.n_estimators=120
	  ```
- dvc dag: dag = directed acyclic graph

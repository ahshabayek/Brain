- preagile:
	- BEST FOR LOW COST CHANGE
	- partially defined
- scientific
	- best for high cost of change well defined projects.
- software?
	- low cost.

- mismanagment:
	- wrong product
	- inferior quality
	- late
	- working more
- find the compromise
	- data while project is running
- Agile is knowing where you are so that you manage outcome.
	- delievers needed bad news
- Trade offs:
	- quality
	- fast
	- cheap
	- done

- pick three iron cross
	- cant have all at 100%
- customer changes can disrupt planning and programmers change estimates(encourged)
- date doesnt change but software specs does.

- what is a story?:
	- a brief description of how to use the system.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1695727878776_0.png)
	- a use case.
	- Estimable requires expected result to be concise.
	- can always be broken up and estimations flexible.
	- buisness value.
	- at most 1 man week.
	- the test is the specification
	-
	- index cards:
		- one word like flashcards
		- no details should be captured
		- memory triggering
		- capture spirit and intend not details

- how to estimate:
- 1 hand estimation
- break feature down
- make it a card even if 0 then clip together to 1.
- tear card in half put one in deck and  the other half finished before sprint end.
- turn estimation into a story if need be:
	- called a spike (tracer bullet)
	- may need to even write code.
-
- acceptance tests are the requirements.
-
- Team coposition: 1:2 tester developer ratio. same with QA and should be part of the team.
- book: fit for developing software
- no iteration can fail.:
	- generating data is the point of an iteration.

- points that align with sensor measurement survive and others with lower weight die out.
- particles center around higher posterior probablity

- Terminology:
	- process noisy data (observations/ motions) to estimate underlying true value of a system.
	- genetic algorithm a class iterative algorithms which evolves a population of candidate hypotheses:
		- starting population.
		- fitness function
		- selection process
		- crossover
		- mutation

	- after each step only samples are retained.

		- we dont have access to the target though
		- so..indirect comparison
		- compare target data/ detections with particles
		- localization by indirectly inferring where it exists
		- you can come up with infinite weighting algorithms.
		- weighting:
			- weights are relative, we need to be able to compare them
			- Deterministic: outputs are deductible, same input same output
			- consistent: more similar greater weight.
			- relative proportions: proportions are tunable , irrelevant after PF is developed

		-
		- tuning by changing the variance thus assigning different weights as desired.
	- Resampling:
		- process of choosing a sample from a poulation
		- In PF we sample with replacement
		- with respect to weight
		- lowbias
		- fast
		- not Deterministic
	- Fuzzing:
		-
	- Gist of PF: how likely would it be to observe  a target measurement for each hypothesis? NOT how likely target Hypothesis for measurement.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1708471259735_0.png)
	- direct fuzzing applied after resampling, while indirect happens while moving/mimicing the movement.

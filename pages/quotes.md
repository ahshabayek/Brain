- “What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. These are but 
  trifles, to be sure; but scattered along life's pathway, the good they 
  do is inconceivable.”

- “The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on 
  an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our 
  business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land, to add 
  something to the extent and the solidity of our possessions. And even a 
  cursory glance at the history of the biological sciences during the last
  quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion, that the 
  most potent instrument for the extension of the realm of natural 
  knowledge which has come into men's hands, since the publication of [Newton](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/135106.Newton)'s ‘Principia’, is [Darwin](https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=Darwin)'s ‘Origin of Species.”

- “People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the 
  sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed
  only if there is a light from within.”

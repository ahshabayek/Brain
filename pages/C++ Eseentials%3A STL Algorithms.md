- The STL in a nutshell:
	- Containers: implementation of data collections.
	- Algorithms: work on data contained in containers.
	- Iterators: The glue between containers and algorithms.(the abstraction layer)
	- Function Objects: provide flexibility and customizability.
	- Adapters: adapting the basic containers to special ones.
	- Allocators : Generalization and customization of memory allocation.

- No Raw loops:
	- when using range loop pair with auto reference.
	-
- Increments
	- prefix: ++iter
	- Postfix: iter++  returns a copy, high cost
	- alittle like pointer
	- an iterator is a pointer one way relationship.

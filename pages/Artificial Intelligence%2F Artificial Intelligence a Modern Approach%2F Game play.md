	- can grow exponentially b^d
	- Depth limited search
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1726261584972_0.png)
		- an evaluation function is then needed as trees might not reach deep enough for solution
		-
	- iterative deepening
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1726322615133_0.png)
		- almost free in exponential problems
		- always have an answer limited to time constraints
	- Horizon effect trouble
		- cant search enough in the future to see the problem
		- use better evaluation
	- MinMax
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1726409271401_0.png)
		-
	- ALpha Beta pruning
		- a more efficient min max, this is done by quiting branch exploration when a possible min or max is found

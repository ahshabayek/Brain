- a set of neurons connected to compute a problem
- a neuron is a tiny computer very similar to a single logistic regression [[Machine Learning/ Supervised Learning/ Classification/ Logistic regression]] algo.

- relevant features for each neuron is weight during training to pick the relevant ones and focus on them

- features are made into a vector, so are weights.
- so neural network is a set of layers with input vectors processed to output a vector at each layer or hidden layers (middle layers).
- Neural networks architecture is the choice of number of hidden layers, neurons per layer.

- by giving different data the neural network will learn how to generalize.
- Neural networks layers:

	- output of each layer is the estimated probability of input vector/ image

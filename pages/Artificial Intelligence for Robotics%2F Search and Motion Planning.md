- minimum cost plan

- Dynamic programming: value iteration:
	- every step /position has a plan/computation.
	- work recursively from goal to current and add up cost.
	- hill climbing action

- brute force is not a best first search algo but its optimal.

- is it a best fit search? yes. priority applied by looking at all current level. prioritazation makes it a breadth first search.
- is it optimal, yes.  this is under the assumption of uniform cost. otherwise it is not optimal. only with equal action cost.

- best first search , yes
- optimal? yes.

- best first search? yes
- optimal? no
- Also known as greedy best first search

- best first search, yes
- optimal,yes. but

- Heuristics dont need to be the correct one
- should not strive for accuracy in heuristics.
- A* with admissible heuristics is optimal.

- what is an admissible heuristic:
	- never overestimates cost, lower than lowest actual cost
	- optimistic by nature

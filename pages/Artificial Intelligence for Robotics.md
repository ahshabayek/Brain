- an entity is considered intelligent if it chooses actions that are expected to achieve its objectives, given what it has perceived.
- a programmable machine capable of thinking and taking action in the world autonomously/ without human control.
-
- localization called SLAM, or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, that does not need a good map prior to beginning.
- Terminology
	- prior : intial belief distribution
	- posterior: updated belief distribution after new info
	- mutuallly exclusive: disjoint events
	- collectivelly exhaustive: a collection of events that fill the state space
	- partition : a sset of events that are mutually and collectively.
	- divide and conquer : breakdown divide and conqeur.
- Law of total probability is for movements.
- Bayes rule is for measurements.

- you are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail.
- you are not to allowed to write more production code than is sufficient to cause currently failing tests to pass.
- forces decoupling of code
- enforces documentation
- easier to make production ready changes faster
- we all write bad code
- to clean up code
- as many threads for test as in code.

- race conditions dont work well with them
- jitter tests: run multiple executables together
- functions that return nothing :
- THree A rule:
	- Arrange: setup
	- Act: single act rule
	- Assert: multiple asserts from 1 action
- Problems:
	- accidental complexity.
	- too slow: in asystem is a hinderence.
	- wide scope
	- colloquialisms: test data should be enough to carry out intent of test.
- solutions for good test:
	- one logical assert
	- no accidental  complexity
	- fast
	- narrow scope
	- meaningful values.

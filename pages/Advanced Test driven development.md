- Not alone to write any production code before writing the test.

- you are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail.
- you are not to allowed to write more production code than is sufficient to cause currently failing tests to pass.
- forces decoupling of code
- enforces documentation
- easier to make production ready changes faster
- we all write bad code
- to clean up code
- as many threads for test as in code.

- race conditions dont work well with them
- jitter tests: run multiple executables together
- functions that return nothing :
- THree A rule:
	- Arrange: setup
	- Act: single act rule
	- Assert: multiple asserts from 1 action
- Problems:
	- accidental complexity.
	- too slow: in asystem is a hinderence.
	- wide scope
	- colloquialisms: test data should be enough to carry out intent of test.
- solutions for good test:
	- one logical assert
	- no accidental  complexity
	- fast
	- narrow scope
	- meaningful values.
- composed test result: may only want to know if test result worked properly but not the details.
- Stubbing vs Mocking( endo testing)
	- idea of mock object.
	- test double stands in for the actual object for testing
	- test double derives from interface.
	- dummy do nothing return degenerate values.
		- int then 0, bool then false
		- allow you to call a function that requires an argument untouched by your test.
		- why? if real object requires complex construction.
	- a Stub is a dummy. they also do nothing but return test needed values.
	- drive system through tested pathway
	- Spy is a stub with a memory. A programmable stubs
	- not all spies are stubs
	- validate if a function is called correctly

	- Mock Object: is a spy , returns values monitors functions. but also expects values
	- this means it asserts expectations
	- pass input authenticator and expectation
	- when you spy you couple to implementation.
	- stub and spy are easy.
- The FAke
	- a simulator. has business rules.
	- Fakes grow bigger with time. to a point that might need their own test.
	- TDD uncertainty principle.
	- stubs dnt break when implementation is changed.
- 2 ways
  id:: 64e374e1-c1e2-441b-81e5-a2aecec750fa
	- Chicago:
		- by return values
		- less certainty of input combination but more robust
	- LOndon
		- by implementation.
		- tests are more certain. but more fragile
	- in a component dnt use spies.
	- between components and architectural boundaries use spies.
- repple: write and execute code directly.
- data driven test.
- Test Design:
	- fragile test  problem: coupled to low level interfaces
	- Decouple the structure.

- base deductions on background knowledge
- learning is incremental, one example at time.
- labeled learning/ supervised learning
- example come in order.
- case based reasoning we store in raw form, however here we try to extract concepts
- number of example to extract concepts is small set
- what to abstract/extract, how to generalize

- Drop link heuristiic

	- generalizing
	- very large learning space drop link heuristic works  to remove overlaps.
- require link heuristic

	- forbid link heuristic

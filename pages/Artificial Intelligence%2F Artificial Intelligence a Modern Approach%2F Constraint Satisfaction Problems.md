- Constraint Graph
- unary / binary or more constraints, many variables
- backtracking search
	- choose already used critieria
	- choose state with most constraints next
	- Minimizing Backtracking and using the least constraining value
	- Minimizing Backtracking and using the minimum remaining value
- Forward checking
	- for each unassigned variable keep track of remaining legal value.
